The economics of open source: For developers
============================================

Benefits
--------

* The software author is able to get work done by someone else
* In return, the someone else has power to influence the direction of the software
* Outcompetes proprietary software because you end up having more manpower working to make your product better


Pitfalls
--------

* Avoid the Sun/gcc/openoffice trap:
  * Open source licensing but a proprietary development model.
  * Anyone can copy, modify and use your software because of the license...
  * But it's hard for external developers to contribute just like proprietary software.
  * You've gained all of the drawbacks of both the open source and the proprietary models.  You are destined for failure.
    * For Sun, failure lead to customers not valuing Sun's products.  Innovation was happening in truly open source projects; Sun's projects were stagnating *in comparison*.
    * For openoffice, the failure lead to an open source fork which vastly outstrips them in popularity.
    * For gcc, the failure lead to an open source fork which eventually reassumed the gcc name.

The Red Hat strategy
--------------------

* Free software, paid support.
  * Content is free.
  * Support is paid.
  * For customers to buy Red Hat, they need to know that our support is superior to what a competitor offers.

* What is support?
  * Not just tech support!
  * Engineering that supports customer needs.
  * I need X feature.
  * I need X performance.
  * I need X bug fixed by Y date.
  * I need code to be audited/certified/to comply with Official Standard.
  * I have written feature and need to get it into upstream
    * supported by more than just us
    * establish our reputation in the marketplace
    * give our engineers a feeling of contributing to open source which makes them happy and therefore more productive

* Red Hat tries to have collaborators rather than competitors:
  * If a customer decides that they can pay their IT department to work on Red Hat software rather than paying Red Hat for it, we can still come out on top if the customer's work is merged into the software.
  * The former customer becomes a development partner: sharing the development costs to make our product better
  * Risk: We are not open to taking the partner's work.  Then the partner becomes a competitor.


The economics of open source: For customers
===========================================

* Not locked into a specific vendor
* Able to utilize existing employees to improve a product you use
* Don't have to wait for upstream release cycles for things that you need
* Able to make things work differently
